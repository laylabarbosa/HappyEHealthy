Purpose of application 
Every new year, we set ambitious goals and select micro habits as stepping stones to our successful path. Yet, how often do we find ourselves forgetting them by mid-year, sometimes even mid-January? Introducing Happy and Health, the habit tracker designed to keep you on the track to success. Choose your habits, define your goals, and easily track your daily progress with an intuitive and aesthetic interface. In case you decide that those goals and habits are not enough anymore, feel free to edit your habits or even start all over again, after all in the game of self-improvement, evolution is key. Stay committed, stay on track – with Happy and Healthy, your journey to a better you just got a whole lot easier.

Concepts to create application
• Connect to a database
• CRUD operations on database based on data input from the app 
• Navigate trough activities in different scenarios (in pause, in resume, destroy)
• Create a time trigger to send input from user to database (especially when input is not created for the day)
